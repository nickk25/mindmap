# Second Brain

Second Brain is a 3D mind mapping application built with Next.js and React Three Fiber. This tool allows you to visualize and navigate your ideas and concepts in an interactive and immersive way.

## Getting Started

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page updates automatically as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize and automatically load Inter, a custom font from Google.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Uses React Three Fiber to render interactive 3D models.
- **Navigation Controls**: Interact with the mind map using orbit and zoom controls.
- **Custom Components**: Custom models and components for a unique experience.
